In addition to global navigation (see **localization** section) our team is adding cameras to aid in robot navigation. For the 2020-21 season, VEX Change Up, teams are tasked with scoring coloured balls into goals. To maximize scoring during fully autonomous matchplay it is necessary to track the contents of each scoring goal and make optimized scoring decisions using this information.

Here is a preview of one of our computer vision based object detection algorithms developed for the 2020-21 season:
